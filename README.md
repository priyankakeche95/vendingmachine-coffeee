# Coffee Vending Machine #

IDeaS just contracted you to design and build a set of coffee machines for their workplace. There are mechanical
designers taking care of all the mechanical parts of the machines. You are responsible for the machine's controlling
software.

IDeaSâ€™ requirements are very simple. They want to provide free coffee for all! :)

### The basic operations that are included in the solution

* Accept coffee selection
* Provide coffee
